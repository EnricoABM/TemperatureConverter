# Temperature Converter

## Project Description
This project consists of a temperature converter between the Celsius, Kelvin, Farenheit, Rankine and Reamur scales. The project was developed in **Java**, using **MVC architecture** and the **Swing Library** to create the graphical user interface.

The project classes were separated as defined by **MVC**, with the layers separated into java packages, where the classes that interact with the end user were contained in the **View package**, the classes referring to the problem domain contained in the **Model package**, finally, the classes that mediate communication between layers are in the **Controller package**. In this way, the software was divided by responsibilities, **improving the potential for reuse** and **future maintainability**.

**The graphical interface was developed** with **Swing components** and with the help of the **Apache NetBeans IDE** screen composer. 
Swing allows for **better application portability**, as all components were developed purely in Java, making the appearance of the interface independent of the client's operating system.
The use of **NetBeans** to create graphical interfaces allows for **dynamic and efficient application development**, allowing the programmer not to worry about component instantiation or positioning, focusing on the layout and implementation of the rest of the application.


## Conclusion
Thanks to the **MVC Architecture**, the software was divided into responsibilities, **improving the potential for reuse and maintainability**. In the future, the project **can be implemented** as a **WEB application efficiently**, with **great reuse of the classes** from the Model and Controller package, only having to worry about the View layer and adapting the Controller layer to a WEB application using Servlet technology .
